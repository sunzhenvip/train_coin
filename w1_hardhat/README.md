# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm install --save-dev hardhat@2.13.0
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@^2.0.2
npx hardhat --version
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
